#### GETTING STARTED

[White Thai](https://github.com/zsandler/thai-blog-project.git "White-Thai") is a food blog for lovers of Thai food in the DC area. It allows users to view others' entries, add their own, edit their own, and delete their own. Each restaurant has 4 attributes: name, location, star rating, and comments. 

You must sign in to add, edit, or delete restauarants.

#### PLANNED FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
Enhance the CSS to make it more common across pages, and to give it more flavor (pun intended?). I also want users to be able to upload photos of the food. I want to be able to pin the newest reviews at the top, and to allow users to search for restaurants based on location and rating.
